  <title>Parking Lot</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Design a parking lot which can hold n cars of different color and different registration numbers.</p>

  <p>Every car has been issued a ticket for a spot and the spot has been assigned based on the nearest to the entry point.</p>

  <p>The system should also return some queries such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Registration numbers of all cars of a particular Color.
      <ul><li>@cars = Car.where(color: "red").pluck(:registration_number)</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ticket number in which a car with a given registration number is placed.
      <ul><li>Car.where(registration_number: "12312212").last.tickets.first.id</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ticket numbers of all ticket where a car of a particular color is placed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This should be simple command line utility with minimum these capabilities. They can develop a simple UI instead of CLI based.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>create a parking lot</li>
    <li>park cars in it</li>
    <li>run the above specified queries</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Language of your choice</p>

  <p>Show us your following skills:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean code</li>
    <li>How to do a modular code</li>
    <li>Unit testing, your code should have at least 80% coverage</li>
    <li>Be creative while designing the solution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Steps</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mkdir parking_lot</li>
    <li>cd parking_lot</li>
    <li>git init</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Write your code and keep committing on each stopping point. After you are done, zip the folder of parking_lot and send us.</p>

  <p>Also, include an approach.txt, write your thoughts or approach, how you have solved the problem</p>
